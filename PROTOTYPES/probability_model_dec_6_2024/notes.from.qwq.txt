Finally, it returns these two probabilities as a tuple.

In the example usage section, it sets some sample values for each of the probabilities: streak_prob is 0.45, stdev_prob is 0.60, and so on, up to spy_prob being 0.68. Then, it defines other_probs as a list containing 0.58 and 0.62, which are probabilities for two additional factors.

The weights are also defined as a list: [0.20, 0.15, 0.25, 0.10, 0.30] plus [0.10, 0.10] for the two additional factors. It mentions that the weights should sum to 1, which they do in this case: 0.20 + 0.15 + 0.25 + 0.10 + 0.30 + 0.10 + 0.10 = 1.00.

Then, it calls the predict_stock_movement function with these values and prints out the probabilities of the stock going up and down, formatted as percentages.

Okay, so overall, the script seems to be attempting to create a model that combines multiple probabilistic factors, each with its own weight, to predict the likelihood of a stock increasing in value.

Now, as for whether the logic is sound, there are a few things to consider.

First, the approach of using a weighted average of different probabilities is reasonable. It allows incorporating multiple factors, each contributing to the final decision based on its assigned importance.

However, there are a few potential issues or areas that could be improved:

Weight Assignment: The weights are hardcoded and sum to 1, which is good. But in a real-world scenario, these weights should be determined based on some statistical analysis or machine learning model that evaluates the importance of each factor in predicting stock movement. Simply assigning arbitrary weights might not lead to accurate predictions.

Independence of Factors: The model assumes that these factors are independent, which might not be the case in reality. For example, streaks and standard deviations could be related, as could interest rates and SPY movement. Correlations between factors could affect the combined probability in ways that a simple weighted average doesn't account for.

Probability Calculation: Each input probability is treated equally in terms of how they're combined, but in reality, some factors might have a nonlinear impact on the stock's movement. For instance, a large standard deviation might indicate higher volatility, which could affect the probability differently depending on its magnitude.

Binary Outcomes: The model only considers two outcomes: up or down. In reality, stock prices can remain stagnant, and movements can be more complex. Considering only two outcomes might oversimplify the possible price actions.

Lack of Error Handling: The function doesn't include any error handling. For example, if the lengths of the probabilities and weights lists don't match, it could cause errors. Adding checks to ensure the inputs are valid would make the function more robust.

Documentation: The docstring is helpful, but it could be more detailed. For example, explaining what each probability represents in more detail, or providing references for how these probabilities are calculated, would be useful for someone trying to understand or use the function.

Example Usage: The example uses hardcoded values, which is fine for illustration, but in a real application, these probabilities would need to be calculated based on actual data. The script doesn't show how these probabilities are derived, which is a crucial part of the model.

In summary, while the script provides a basic framework for combining multiple factors to predict stock movement, it relies on several assumptions and simplifications that may not hold in practice. For a more robust model, considering the interdependencies between factors, using data-driven methods to determine weights, and accounting for a wider range of possible outcomes would be necessary.

Final Solution
To improve the initial script, we need to address some of the limitations mentioned in the analysis. Here's an enhanced version of the script with better documentation, error handling, and a more flexible approach to handling input probabilities and weights.
