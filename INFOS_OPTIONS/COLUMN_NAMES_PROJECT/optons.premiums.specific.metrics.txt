When considering options trading, especially with a directional view but uncertainty about the direction, focusing on volatility and liquidity becomes crucial. High volatility can be beneficial because it increases the premium of options, providing more opportunity to capture premium through strategies like selling options. However, it also increases the risk, so it's essential to manage this risk appropriately.
Metrics to Focus On

    Implied Volatility (IV):
        Higher IV typically means options are more expensive, which can be advantageous for selling options strategies (like selling calls or puts, or iron condors). It allows you to collect higher premiums.
        Lower IV can be beneficial for buying options, as the cost is lower.

    Historical Volatility (HV):
        Compares with IV to identify whether options are overpriced or underpriced.
        If IV is higher than HV, options might be overpriced, which could be favorable for selling options.

    Volatility Skew:
        Measures the difference in implied volatility for out-of-the-money puts versus calls.
        A higher put skew might indicate market fear, which could be exploited through bearish strategies.

    Open Interest:
        Higher open interest indicates more active options trading, which can provide better liquidity for entering and exiting positions.

    Volume:
        Similar to open interest, higher volume suggests more liquidity in the options market.

    Beta:
        Higher beta stocks are more volatile relative to the market, which can lead to higher option premiums but also higher risk.

    Average True Range (ATR):
        Measures market volatility by decomposing the entire range of an asset's price for that period.
        Higher ATR values indicate higher volatility and potentially larger price swings.

    Vega:
        Measures the sensitivity of an option's price to changes in volatility.
        Higher vega means the option's price is more sensitive to volatility changes.

    Implied Volatility Rank (IV Rank):
        Compares current IV to its historical range.
        High IV Rank suggests options are relatively expensive, which can be favorable for selling options.

    Put-Call Ratio:
        Higher put-call ratio can indicate bearish sentiment, which might influence your options trading strategy.

Strategies

Given that you have a directional view but are uncertain about the direction, you might consider strategies that benefit from volatility without taking a specific directional stance:

    Straddles:
        Involves buying both a put and a call with the same strike price and expiration date.
        Profits if the underlying makes a significant move in either direction.

    Strangles:
        Involves buying a put and a call with different strike prices but the same expiration date.
        Similar to straddles but typically with lower cost and wider breakevens.

    Iron Condors:
        Involves selling both a put spread and a call spread at different strike prices.
        Benefits from low volatility and can be adjusted for different volatility expectations.

    Calendar Spreads:
        Involves buying and selling options of the same type, strike price, but different expiration dates.
        Can be used to profit from the passage of time and changes in volatility.

Risk Management

While higher volatility can provide higher premiums, it also increases the potential for larger price swings, which can lead to bigger losses if not managed properly. Therefore, it's crucial to:

    Set Stop-Losses: Define exit points to limit potential losses.
    Manage Position Size: Ensure that no single trade represents an excessive risk to your portfolio.
    Diversify Strategies: Don't put all your capital into one type of options trade; diversify across different strategies and underlying assets.
    Monitor Market Conditions: Stay informed about market news and events that could impact volatility and your positions.
