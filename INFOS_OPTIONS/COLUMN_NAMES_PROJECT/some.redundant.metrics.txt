Yes, some of these metrics are related or can be derived from others, which might make them redundant in certain contexts. Additionally, combining some metrics can create new indicators that provide deeper insights. Here are some observations:
Redundant Metrics

    Average Volume Metrics:
        averageVolume and averageDailyVolume10Day (or averageVolume10days): These measure similar concepts over different periods. If you have one, the other might be redundant depending on the analysis period.

    High and Low Prices:
        dayHigh and dayLow vs. regularMarketDayHigh and regularMarketDayLow: These may overlap, especially if the regular market hours cover the entire trading day.

    Market Cap and Shares Outstanding:
        marketCap can be derived from sharesOutstanding and currentPrice. If you have two of these, the third can be calculated, making one of them redundant.

    Book Value and Price-to-Book:
        priceToBook is derived from currentPrice and bookValue per share. If you have two of these, the third can be calculated.

    Target Price Metrics:
        targetHighPrice, targetLowPrice, targetMeanPrice, and targetMedianPrice all relate to analyst target prices. Depending on your analysis, you might choose to use only one or a combination of these.

    Short Interest Metrics:
        sharesShort, sharesShortPriorMonth, shortPercentOfFloat, and shortRatio all pertain to short interest. You might not need all of them, depending on what aspect of short interest you're analyzing.

Derived Metrics

    PE Ratio:
        trailingPE and forwardPE can be calculated if you have currentPrice and trailingEps or forwardEps, respectively.

    Price-to-Sales Ratio:
        priceToSalesTrailing12Months can be calculated using currentPrice and revenuePerShare.

    EBITDA Margin:
        ebitdaMargins can be calculated from ebitda and totalRevenue.

    Operating Margin:
        operatingMargins can be calculated from operating income and totalRevenue.

    Profit Margin:
        profitMargins can be calculated from net income and totalRevenue.

    Return on Assets (ROA):
        returnOnAssets can be calculated from netIncomeToCommon and total assets.

    Return on Equity (ROE):
        returnOnEquity can be calculated from netIncomeToCommon and shareholders' equity.

    Debt-to-Equity Ratio:
        debtToEquity can be calculated from totalDebt and shareholders' equity.

    Current Ratio:
        currentRatio is current assets divided by current liabilities.

    Quick Ratio:
        quickRatio is (current assets - inventory) divided by current liabilities.

    Inventory Turnover:
        Can be calculated from cost of goods sold and average inventory.

    Asset Turnover:
        Can be calculated from totalRevenue and average total assets.

    Interest Coverage Ratio:
        Can be calculated from EBIT and interest expense.

    Free Cash Flow per Share:
        Can be calculated by dividing freeCashflow by sharesOutstanding.

    Dividend Yield:
        If dividend per share is available, it can be calculated by dividing annual dividends per share by currentPrice.

    Price/Earnings to Growth (PEG) Ratio:
        trailingPegRatio is trailingPE divided by earnings growth rate.

Additional Metrics

    Earnings Yield:
        Calculated as trailingEps divided by currentPrice.

    Gross Profit:
        Calculated as totalRevenue minus cost of goods sold.

    Operating Income:
        Calculated as ebitda minus depreciation and amortization.

    Net Profit Margin:
        Calculated as net income divided by totalRevenue.

    Share Buyback Ratio:
        Calculated as shares repurchased divided by sharesOutstanding.

    Research and Development (R&D) Expense Ratio:
        Calculated as R&D expenses divided by totalRevenue.

    Capital Expenditure (CapEx) Ratio:
        Calculated as capital expenditures divided by totalRevenue.

    Inventory Turnover Ratio:
        Calculated as cost of goods sold divided by average inventory.

    Receivables Turnover Ratio:
        Calculated as totalRevenue divided by average accounts receivable.

    Payables Turnover Ratio:
        Calculated as cost of goods sold divided by average accounts payable.

By understanding these relationships, you can decide which metrics to keep and which to derive as needed, streamlining your analysis and ensuring you have the most relevant data for comparison.
